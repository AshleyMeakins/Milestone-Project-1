# Pendulum

This website is about the fusion drum and bass band, mixing many different genre's into their music. All pages share the same footer an nav, with a spotify player in the footer.

-------------------------

# UX

This project is about createing a front-end website for a band. The target audiences are fans and possible fans of the band who would like to know a little more about the band's history, and potentially listen to their music.

# Features

## Index Page

The index page Greets you with a slideshow, made by following the guide in references, to present you with a few images of the band from the start. The index page also has a brief description of whats happened with the band, and a video of their latest concert, which was held at a fort. Streamed free on youtube, anyone could watch it, considering the state of the world right now, they felt better not to bring an audience all closed together.

## About Page

The about page is where i featured most of the information about the band, conntaining brief descriptions on what each band member does, through the use of hovering over their picture and the text will appear. It also contained information on the 3 Studio albums released, opting not to do the same hover effect used on the band members, as there was a lot more text, and felt clunky as you would sometimes have to scroll to reveal the text, resulting in having to mouse over again because i scrolled so much.

## Bookings Page

The bookings page has a newsletter for fans that want to recieve news about the band's upcoming tours via email, with the email being required to send. There is also a form for people that wish to book the band to perform at their venue, with all fields being required apart from the "tell us about the Venue" as that would more then likely be further discussed in proceeding Emails/Phone calls which they would choose which method they would prefer contact.

# Issues

- On the Index page, there is an issue with the slideshow that is causing it to stay at the top while everything else after that would appear behind it, and I tried numerous things but couldn't figure out why. Instead I worked around it but just adding a large margin at the top of the next segment. I know the issue could be fixed so I didnt have to do the silly workaround, with the silly part being it was probably something incredibly obvious.
- The footer also caused a similar issue like the slideshow did, where i had to put a bottom margin on whatever would be the lowest on each page.

# Personal thoughts on the project

Personally, I really wish I could have done better. The silly little mistakes costing more time then it did creating what I currently have, I really struggled coming up with ideas on how to make the site look nice,  I was given so much time to do this project but I unfortunately got delayed due to work, but "*luckily*" we had to go into a 2nd lockdown due to covid, which actually allowed me the time to do this project, I dont know if I could have done it if not for that.
